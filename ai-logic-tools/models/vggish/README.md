# Project Setup Instruction
> **Add Vggish checkpoint file here**. 

>The checkpoint file contains the data for the
> pre-trained ai model. The file name **MUST** be `vggish_model.ckpt`.

> *Do not commit this file to the repository as it is too large!
> As long as the filename matches `vggish_model.ckpt`, 
> the gitignore file will ignore it.*
